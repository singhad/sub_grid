    "A model is constructed that uses micro-turbulence and a log-normal probability distribution function (PDF) to describe the unresolved density fluctuations inside a macroscopic volume element. Jeans length is used to establish the length scale of the absorber for these density fluctuations. The molecular fractions of $H_2$ and $CO$ are computed, also taking into account the self-shielding effect of $H_2$. Then, a simplified model for radiative transfer is introduced to compute the line emission of $CO$. This sub-grid model is then used to post process a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a $z\\approx 0.6$ galaxy ($M_{\\star}\\approx 2\\times 10^{10} \\rm{M_{\\odot}}$, $\\rm{SFR} \\approx 2 \\rm{M_{\\odot} yr^{-1}}$, $M_{\\rm{gas}}\\approx 10^{10} \\rm{M_{\\odot}}$) to study the molecular fraction of $H_2$ and $CO$, and also the line luminosity of $CO$. The total luminosity of the galaxy computed for the $CO(1-0)$ transition is $L_{CO} = 7.3\\times 10^{7}\\rm{K km s^{-1} pc^{2}}$ if only thermal microscopic motions in the absorber are considered, and is found to be $L_{CO} = 1.9\\times 10^{9}\\rm{K km s^{-1} pc^{2}}$ if a model for micro-turbulence is considered inside the absorber. The total mass of $H_2$ in the galaxy is computed to be $M_{H_2} = 2.9\\times10^{9} \\rm{M_{\\odot}}$. This gives a mass-to-luminosity ratio $\\alpha_{CO} = 39 \\rm{M_{\\odot} (K km s^{-1} pc^{2})^{-1}}$ for the pure thermal model, while for the micro-turbulence model $\\alpha_{CO} = 1.5 \\rm{M_{\\odot} (K km s^{-1} pc^{2})^{-1}}$. Considering the power-law PDF for the density fluctuations, the total luminosity of the galaxy computed for the $CO(1-0)$ transition is $L_{CO} = 6.1\\times 10^{7}\\rm{K km s^{-1} pc^{2}}$ for the pure thermal motions, and $L_{CO} = 1.1\\times 10^{9}\\rm{K km s^{-1} pc^{2}}$ if micro-turbulence is considered. The mass-to-luminosity ratio in this regime is $\\alpha_{CO} = 46 \\rm{M_{\\odot} (K km s^{-1} pc^{2})^{-1}}$ for the pure thermal model, and $\\alpha_{CO} = 2.7 \\rm{M_{\\odot} (K km s^{-1} pc^{2})^{-1}}$ for the micro-turbulence model, which is in better agreement with observed galaxies."
