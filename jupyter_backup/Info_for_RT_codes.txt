rad_transf - Very first attempt at RT - only copy in hard disk - don't know working status
radiative_transfer - initial version of code with everything essentially pasted and modified from Tine's code - functional code
radiative_transder_testing - for playground testing different RT codes

only files to care about are in the folder files_code_A:

debug_1.5.py - Lognormal-PDF + LTE : for c_S_CO and delta_v regimes
debug_1.6.py - Lognormal-PDF + non-LTE : for c_S_CO and delta_v regimes
debug_1.7.py - Power-Law-PDF + LTE : for c_S_CO and delta_v regimes
debug_1.8.py - Power-Law-PDF + non-LTE : for c_S_CO and delta_v regimes

and their respective plotting files. Note: these are all parallel code files, so can't run them on PC without modifying for single-core operation.

pdf_evolution.ipynb - for PDF Evolution only, this will give the power-law PDF tail, including plots.

plotting_sub_grid.ipynb - for the sub-grid model + RT, this includes the code and plotting both

model_debugging.ipynb - for model predictions, code and plotting of luminosity debnsity for c_s_CO and delta_v vs n_H_mean(-> n_H_mean_arr user defined, not sim values).

reference_plots_1.0.ipynb - for model predictions, code and plotting of X_H2_bar & X_CO_bar (varying M, Z, G_0) vs n_H_mean(-> n_H_mean_arr user defined, not sim values).
